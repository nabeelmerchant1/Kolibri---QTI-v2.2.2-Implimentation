          Democratic socialists have been one of the breakout groups
          of the 2018 election season, but many voters don't know what
          exactly they stand for. Do you? <a rel="related">RELATED ARTICLE</a>

        <p>Democratic socialists have been one of the breakout groups
          of the 2018 midterm elections, springing to national
          attention in June with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s upset of a
          10-term incumbent, the chairman of the House Democratic
          Caucus.</p>
        
        <p>But for all their electoral triumphs so far, democratic
          socialism remains poorly understood and is frequently
          conflated, incorrectly, with communism — or, on the flip
          side, with European-style social democracy. So we built a
          quiz to help you understand what it is, and how your own
          political views compare with it.</p>

        <p>A word of caution before we start: Just like “liberal” or
          “conservative,” the term “democratic socialist” can mean
          different things to different people. For the purposes of
          this quiz, we are using the definition promoted by the
          Democratic Socialists of America, the largest socialist
          organization in the United States.</p>

        <p>Forty D.S.A.-affiliated candidates have won primaries this
          year, the organization says, and eight others were nominated
          after running unopposed. If you hear a 2018 candidate
          describe her- or himself as a democratic socialist, it is a
          safe bet that they mean this kind.</p>
