      Let’s start with the big question. In an ideal world, who
      would control the means of production?

    <p><strong>You disagree with democratic socialists.</strong>
    They believe that an economy based on private profit — in
    other words, capitalism — is inherently exploitative. This is
    a key difference between democratic socialism and mainstream
    progressivism, including European-style social democracy.</p>

    <p>Democratic socialists see social democracies “as an
    improvement over the present situation in the United States,”
    said Maria Svart, the national director of the D.S.A., but
    “it’s really still society and the economy functioning on
    terms that are set by the capitalist class. Our ultimate goal
    is for working people to run our society and run our
    workplaces and our economies.”</p>

    <p>They don’t want Soviet-style state control of the
    economy. While they believe a small number of industries would
    be best administered by the government, they oppose
    authoritarianism and support a mostly decentralized economy
    controlled by workers and consumers, such as through
    cooperatives.</p>

    <p><strong>You disagree with democratic socialists.</strong>
    Democratic socialists don’t want the government to control the
    economy as it did in, for example, the Soviet Union. Leninism,
    Stalinism, Maoism — none of those ideologies are democratic
    socialism.</p>

    <p>Democratic socialists explicitly reject authoritarian forms
    of communism. While they do believe that a small number of
    industries, including energy and steel, would be best
    administered by the government, they support a mostly
    decentralized economy controlled by workers and consumers,
    such as through cooperatives.</p>

    <p>“Our ultimate goal is for working people to run our society
    and run our workplaces and our economies,” said Maria Svart,
    the national director of the D.S.A. “It’s a vision of
    actually, truly democratizing the economy, not just taking a
    lot of public services away from the profit-seeking private
    marketplace.”</p>

    <p><strong>You agree with democratic socialists.</strong> They
    believe that wherever possible, industries should be
    controlled by the workers who operate them and the consumers
    who depend on them — not by corporations, and not by the
    government either. Essentially, they believe that the more
    control that is directly in workers’ hands, the better.</p>

    <p>“Our ultimate goal is for working people to run our society
    and run our workplaces and our economies,” said Maria Svart,
    the national director of the D.S.A. “It’s a vision of
    actually, truly democratizing the economy, not just taking a
    lot of public services away from the profit-seeking private
    marketplace.”</p>

    <p>Democratic socialists do believe that a small number of
    industries, including energy and steel, would be best
    administered by the government. But generally speaking, they
    want a decentralized economy. They explicitly oppose
    authoritarian communism as seen in the Soviet Union; instead,
    they favor arrangements like workers’ cooperatives.</p>
