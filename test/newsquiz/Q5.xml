    <p><strong>You disagree with democratic socialists.</strong>
      They believe health care — along with necessities like food,
      housing, education and child care — is a basic right that
      should be guaranteed to everyone.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, democratic socialists want a fully socialized
      health care system, somewhat like Britain’s, in which the
      government covers the cost of care and the doctors and other
      medical personnel are public employees. This is distinct
      from a system like “Medicare for all,” in which the
      government would cover the cost of care but personnel would
      remain privately employed, and medical facilities privately
      operated. However, democratic socialists support “Medicare
      for all” in the meantime because they acknowledge that a
      fully socialized system isn’t politically achievable right
      now.</p>

    <p><strong>You disagree with democratic socialists.</strong>
      While you agree that the government has a role to play in
      ensuring access to health care, democratic socialists
      believe health care — along with necessities like food,
      housing, education and child care — is a basic right that
      should be guaranteed to everyone. They also believe that
      middle-of-the-road solutions like the Affordable Care Act
      further divisions between the middle class (who can afford
      insurance if given tax credits and subsidies) and the poor
      (who may still be unable to afford it, and who suffer if
      government programs like Medicaid receive less of the health
      care budget).</p>

    <p><strong>You partly agree with democratic socialists.</strong>
      Like you, they believe health care — along with necessities
      like food, housing, education and child care — is a basic
      right that should be guaranteed to everyone. But they want to
      go a step further and create a fully socialized health care
      system, somewhat like Britain’s, in which the government
      covers the cost of care and doctors and other medical
      personnel are public employees. Under “Medicare for all,” by
      contrast, the government would cover the cost of care but
      personnel would remain privately employed, and medical
      facilities privately operated.</p>
    
    <p>That being said, democratic socialists do support “Medicare
      for all” in the meantime because they acknowledge that a
      fully socialized system isn’t politically achievable right
      now.</p>
