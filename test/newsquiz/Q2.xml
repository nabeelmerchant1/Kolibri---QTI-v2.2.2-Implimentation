      In a capitalist system, do you believe government regulations
      are helpful or harmful?

    <p><strong>You agree with democratic socialists.</strong> They
    believe that as long as private corporations exist — and they
    freely acknowledge that that will be the case for the
    foreseeable future — the government should regulate them in
    order to, in their view, mitigate the harms of capitalism and
    push companies to act in the best interests of workers and
    society as a whole. For example, a democratic socialist might
    support strengthening labor laws, raising the minimum wage,
    mandating parental leave, barring companies from outsourcing
    jobs to low-wage countries and banning environmentally harmful
    activities.</p>
