      Do you believe labor unions are a positive force?

    <p><strong>You agree with democratic socialists.</strong> They
      believe unions are essential on two fronts: to hold companies
      accountable to their workers and, in the long term, to empower
      workers to challenge capitalism as a whole.</p>

    <p>Making it easier for workers to unionize “changes the power
      dynamic between workers and bosses,” Ms. Svart said. Strikes
      “demonstrate that our society can’t function without the work of
      millions of people,” she added. “They can’t run the economy
      without us.”</p>

    <p>Ultimately, democratic socialists want workers to control the
      means of production. In the meantime, they see unions as a way
      to give workers more power under capitalism.</p>
