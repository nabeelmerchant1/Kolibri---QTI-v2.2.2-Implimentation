      Ideally, how should major social or political changes be
      achieved?

    <p><strong>You partly agree with democratic
    socialists.</strong> They support and participate in the
    electoral process, and they believe any socialist government
    must be achieved democratically, with the support of a
    majority of the population. But they don’t believe the
    electoral and legislative processes are sufficient on their
    own.</p>

    <p>Crucial to the democratic socialist philosophy is the
    desire for workers to achieve changes for themselves — for
    instance, through unions and tenant organizations — rather
    than relying on people in traditional positions of
    authority.</p>

    <p>“We would prefer, for example, for us to win universal rent
    control in New York through organizing millions of New
    Yorkers,” Ms. Svart said. “We believe that it’s through the
    process of pushing for these changes that people empower
    themselves.”</p>

    <p><strong>You agree with democratic socialists.</strong>
    While they support and participate in the electoral process
    (as evidenced by the many D.S.A. candidates this year), they
    believe the ideal way to make change is through mass
    mobilization and organizing.</p>

    <p><strong>You disagree with democratic socialists.</strong>
    This is a common point of misunderstanding for people who
    conflate democratic socialism with communism. Democratic
    socialists don’t support a revolution to overthrow
    capitalism; they believe change should happen, well,
    democratically. “Any possible transition to socialism would
    necessitate mass mobilization and the democratic legitimacy
    garnered by having demonstrated majority support,”
    Mr. Schwartz and Mr. Schulman wrote.</p>

    <p>Democratic socialists support and participate in the
