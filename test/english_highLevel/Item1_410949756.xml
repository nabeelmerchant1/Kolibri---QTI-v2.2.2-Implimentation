      Europe is no longer the United StatesÂ´ chief supplier of
      immigrants. The lead passed to Asia and Latin America in the 1960s,
      and by the next decade their arrivals were outnumbering those from the
      Old World by four to one.  Nationwide they still comprise a small
      minority, yet they also have changed the ethic mix of a half-dozen and
      more major metropolitan centers.  Although an extreme case, Greater
      Los Angeles exemplifies the forces at work.  Ist Hispanic presence has
      increased threefold and ist Asian ten- fold over the last twenty-five
      years.

      More immigrants, and more different kinds of immigrants, have
      entered the United States than any other country in modern history.
      The conditions that led them to leave their homelands varied:
      overpopulation, contracting economic opportunities, famine, war,
      religious persecution, political oppression.  Whatever the push that
      set them in motion, the pull that lured them to America was the
      promise of a fresh start.  Much the same reasons explain why newcomers
      are still coming, close to four million in the last decade, not
      counting an unknown but doubtlessly large number of illegal
      entrants<sup>1</sup>.
