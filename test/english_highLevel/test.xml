          <h1>LOST IN AMERICA</h1>

          <p>
            Elsa Flores fled El Salvador´s civil war in 1980, moved to
            Los Angeles and cleaned offices until she had saved enough
            money to open a small clothing store.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            But her American dream fell apart in 1992 when racial
            tensions, videotape and a controversial court verdict
            erupted into the Rodney King riots<sup>1</sup>.  Flores
            huddled with her four children in a back bedroom. They could
            hear gunfire and shouting outside. Watching the news on TV,
            they saw flames dance from the window of her clothing
            store. Flores assumed the rioters who destroyed her business
            were black. But then she caught a glimpse of them on
            camera. They were like her: Latinos. Now she says: "They are
            not bad people, but they become frustrated here." The
            ambiguous role that Latinos played in those events
            underscores a much-ignored phenomenon: the vast new wave of
            low-skilled immigrants has yet to find its place in the
            United States. Like Flores, who scrimped and borrowed and
            rebuilt, most Latino immigrants bring enough ambition with
            them to compensate for a lack of education. About two thirds
            achieve at least a working-class income. But many others,
            though equally determined, fail. And more significantly,
            their children often fail. Latinos are in danger of becoming
            locked into the same distinctly American form of poverty
            that has been perpetuated through generations of inner-city
            blacks. In fact, if current trends persist, in another
            decade, Latinos will replace blacks as the United States´
            biggest underclass. More than 30 percent of Latinos who
            arrived in the 1980s live below the poverty line.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            For many immigrants, the journey north is an attempt to
            overcome centuries-old barriers of race and class. What they
            find is new barriers of class and race. The immigrants who
            have the strongest memories of home do best in the States;
            however bad, it is still an improvement. But for their
            children, who often have no memory of home, America seems
            like a raw deal. They watch their parents and see only toil
            and poverty. They watch American TV and see only
            affluence. Public-school systems on the brink of collapse
            fail to give them the tools they need. "I can tell by
            looking in their eyes how long they´ve been here, " says the
            Rev. Vergil Elizondo, of San Antonio, Texas. "They come
            sparkling with hope, and the first gener- ation finds that
            hope rewarded. Their children´s eyes no longer sparkle. They
            have learned only to want jobs and money they can´t have."
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Take the case of Mexican newcomers. Last year the National
            Research Council, America´s most distinguished society of
            scholars, found that Mexican immigrants start out with the
            lowest wages of any nationality and that the wage gap grows
            the longer they live in the United States.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The statistics for their children are even more troubling.
            Nationally, teenage births are declining. But not so for
            girls of Mexican descent, for whom the rate has risen by a
            third during the 1990s. Last year nearly 11 percent of
            Latino teenage girls gave birth double the rate for whites,
            and for the first time surpasseing the rate for
            blacks. School-dropout rates are also gloomy.  The
            U.S. Department of Education estimates that 44 percent of
            foreignborn Latino youths between the ages of 16 and 24 are
            dropouts. That number for American-born children of
            immigrants is 17 percent; for blacks it is 13 percent, for
            whites, 17 percent. Because secondgeneration Latinos are the
            fastest-growing source of new American workers,their lack of
            basic skills could put a brake on the national economy.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            In the search for solutions to America´s growing Latino
            underclass, the simplest proposal has been to reduce the
            flow of lowskilled immigrants. That may be politically
            expedient, but it won´t work. The truth is that the United
            States needs these people. In a decade, when the bulk of the
            baby-boom generation<sup>2</sup> hits retirement age, there
            will be a tremendous shortage of young workers. More than a
            third of the Latino population is under the age of 18. The
            vast majority are native-born U.S. citizens, and they are
            not going anywhere. They are the nation´s future. Unless new
            avenues of opportunity open up for Latino immigrants and
            their children, the nation as a whole will suffer. Remedies
            are still possible.  A generation of young people is still
            in school waiting to be taught, and expectations are still
            alive. But the opportunities are rapidly disappearing.
