  <div class="numbered">
    <p>It all started that night.</p>

    <p>It had started before that, of course, but that was the
    night I realized whose life was at stake: mine. Professor
    Fleischkopf was after me—he aimed to get me in his
    clutches.</p>

    <p>I WAS IN MORTAL DANGER.</p>

    <p>It must have been around midnight. Enrico and Caruso, the
    singing guinea pigs, had finally shut up, and Sir William,
    the civilized tomcat, had retired to his blanket. Mr. John
    wasn’t there. He’d had to go away for a few days.</p>

    <p>I was seated at the keyboard of the Mac, working on a short
    story.  Nights are my favorite time for writing. For one
    thing, because we golden hamsters are always wide awake at
    that hour (science teachers describe us as “nocturnally
    active”), and, for another, because it’s when I have the Mac
    all to myself (Mr. John normally uses it for his
    translations during the day). What I was writing that night
    is beside the point (okay, it was a horror story titled “The
    Curse of the Weasel”). In any event, my paws were typing
    away briskly.</p>

    <p>I worked away in silence.</p>

    <p>Of course, there were all kinds of noises to be heard. The
    ticking of Mr. John’s alarm clock, for instance, and the
    purring of the fridge in the kitchen, the dull roar of the
    traffic on the street below, and the hum of the Mac and the
    click of the keys as I pressed them down with my paws. But
    none of these noises sounded particularly loud, even to a
    hamster’s highly sensitive ears, and besides, they were
    normal at that time of night.</p>

    <p>I continued working in silence.</p>

    <p>And then, just as I was rereading what I’d typed on the
    screen, I heard the front door open downstairs. This wasn’t
    unusual in itself.  We live in a big apartment building (on
    the very top floor), and people sometimes come home
    late. Besides, the door to the street is never locked. In a
    moment I was sure I would hear it shut, followed by
    footsteps on the stairs and the sound of a neighbor’s door
    being opened.</p>

    <p>But no, this time it was nothing like that.</p>

    <p>The front door must have been closed so carefully, not even
    I had heard it. I strained my ears. Then came the sound of
    very soft footsteps. Someone was tiptoeing up the
    stairs.</p>

    <p>The footsteps drew nearer. They didn’t come to a halt
    outside any of the apartments below us, but continued to
    climb, growing louder and louder.</p>

    <p>They reached the top of the stairs.</p>

    <p>I stiffened.</p>

    <p>Silence.</p>

    <p>There was a sudden, faint jingling sound, as if someone had
    removed a bunch of keys from his pocket.</p>

    <p>Another silence.</p>

    <p>Then two things happened: First, I heard someone insert
    something in the lock; second, a smell hit me.</p>

    <p>A sudden, acrid stench of sulfur.</p>

    <p>I realized who was standing outside the door.</p>

    <p>It was yesterday’s visitor—the man who had suddenly
    appeared in Mr. John’s study.</p>

    <p>It was Professor Fleischkopf.</p>
