    <p>Now, in the middle of the night, I detected that smell
    again. It was seeping into the apartment through the cracks
    around the front door.  Professor Fleischkopf had to be
    standing just outside.</p>

    <p>What was more, he’d inserted something in the lock.</p>

    <p>HE WAS TRYING TO BREAK IN!</p>

    <p>I rose on my hind legs, fur bristling.</p>

    <p>I was paralyzed at first, but then I pulled myself
    together. Darting to the opposite end of the desk, I climbed
    down my miniature rope ladder at top speed, reached the
    floor, and scurried into the room next door, where Sir
    William was lying on his cat blanket. He was fast
    asleep.</p>

    <p>“Sir William!” I hissed.</p>

    <p>No reaction.</p>

    <p>“Sir William!”</p>

    <p>A subdued snore, then silence again.</p>

    <p>I listened hard. Faint scraping, rattling sounds were
    coming from the direction of the front door. Professor
    Fleischkopf was evidently trying to open it with a skeleton
    key.</p>

    <p>“Sir William!”</p>

    <p>Still no response.</p>

    <p>So I bit him. I bit his paw—not very hard, but it
    worked. Sir William woke up with a start.</p>

    <p>“Freddy!” he said, wringing his paw. “Are you out of your
    mind? What do you mean by—” He broke off and pricked his
    ears. “There’s someone there. Outside the front door.”</p>

    <p>“Exactly,” I whispered. “He’s trying to get in.”</p>

    <p>We listened. Something was withdrawn from the lock and
    something else inserted: Professor Fleischkopf was trying
    another skeleton key.</p>

    <p>Sir William sniffed the air. “It’s that man from
    yesterday—the one with the disgusting shampoo. But what’s he
    doing here?”</p>

    <p>“He’s come to get me.”</p>

    <p>“You?” Sir William stared down at me, shaking his head. “My
    dear Freddy, you’ll have to explain. Why on earth would
    anyone—”</p>

    <p>Click! went the door.</p>

    <p>“He’s inside! He’s coming!”</p>

    <p>“Quick, hide!” hissed Sir William. “Hide someplace. I'll
    try to distract him. . . . No, wait!”</p>

    <p>“He hasn’t broken in after all,” I whispered. “Not
    yet.”</p>

    <p>“All right, go look for a hiding place. I’ll see what I can
    do.” Sir William sighed. “I wish I could bark. I never
    thought the day would come when I wished I could—”</p>

    <p>“Ssh!” I listened. “Footsteps . . . on the stairs
    . . . going down . . .  HE’S RETREATING! He’s given up.”</p>

    <p>“Really?” Sir William listened too. “You’re right. Phew!”
    He lay down on his blanket again, then looked at me. “Well,
    I must say! Next time, my young friend, I suggest you
    administer excitement in slightly smaller doses. But now
    tell me, why do you think the man was after you?”</p>

    <p>“It was those eyes of his,” I said, and I described how
    Professor Fleischkopf had focused his ice-cold gaze on
    me.</p>

    <p>“Well, it certainly doesn’t sound like love at first
    sight,” said Sir William. “But the question is: Why? I mean,
    what does he want you for?” He thought a moment. “If this
    Professor Fleischkopf really wants to get you in his
    clutches, he’s bound to try again.”</p>

    <p>Suddenly Sir William raised his head. “Hey! He introduced
    himself as Professor Schmidt. How do you know his name is
    Fleischkopf?”</p>
