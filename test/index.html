    <h1>QTI.JS Sample Tests</h1>

    <p>QTI.JS is a Javascript-based, free and open-source, delivery
      engine for tests and assessments, which almost fully implements Version
      2.2 of the IMS Question & Test Interoperability (QTI)
      <a href="https://www.imsglobal.org/question/index.html">
        specification.</a></p>

    <p>Quoting IMS, "QTI enables the exchange of item (question) and
      test content and results data between authoring tools, test
      construction tools, learning platforms, assessment delivery
      systems, and scoring/analytics engines."  First released in
      1999, QTI has become the primary standard for interoperable
      assessment content within the education technology world, and is
      supported by most popular Learning Management platforms,
      Assessment and Question Authoring tools, and Assessment Delivery
      Systems.</p>

    <p>QTI.JS supports all 21 QTI question types, all processing
      operators, templates, adaptive items, all feedback types,
      rubrics, shared assessment stimulus blocks, conditional
      questions, branching, selection and ordering, linear and
      non-linear tests, individual and simultaneous submission,
      results reporting, MathML and many other QTI Version 2.2
      features.  It is serverless, requires no configuration, and is
      fully themable. It is likely the most complete implementation of
      QTI Version 2.2 delivery features yet to be released.</p>

    <p>QTI.JS is currently in preview/beta release, and is aiming for
      production release and certification by IMS in early 2019. The
      source code of QTI.JS has been released on
      <a href="https://github.com/QTIJS/QTI.JS">GitHub</a> under an
      MIT license.</p>
    
    <p>This site provides sample QTI assessment tests delivered
      by QTI.JS.  This site is entirely static, running from an Amazon
      S3 bucket, underscoring that QTI.JS provides serverless delivery of
      QTI content.</p>
    
    <p>For best results, use a recent version of Google
      Chrome, since other browsers have not yet received much
      attention.</p>

          <em>IMS QTI Implementation Guide Version 2.2</em></a>, plus
          a few we added. Sixty items in all, which show all 21 QTI
          interaction types, templates, adaptive items, composite
          items, MathML support, rubrics, all types of feedback, and
          many other QTI features.  Uses the "qtijs" theme, which adds
          the QTI.JS logo and a few other tweaks to the "basic" (default)
          theme. "Non-linear" scrolling-based navigation.  </td>

          interoperability of TAO and QTI.JS, and support by QTI.JS
          of the somewhat complex QTI content packaging structures
          used by TAO. Shows the QTI.JS "basic" (default) theme without

          standard response processing templates, and inline and modal
          feedback. The QTI.JS take on this package adds a custom
          QTI.JS theme, responsive with two columns, falling back to
          one column on narrow devices. Non-linear.</td>

            <em>Grade 5 English Language Arts/Literacy - Literary
            Analysis Task.</em>
          </a> The QTI rendition of these items features
          choiceInteraction, extendedTextInteraction,
          gapMatchInteraction, and multiple assessmentStimulus
          elements.  The QTI.JS theme is custom and features an imaginary
          PARCC livery, showing how QTI tests can be presented using
          QTI.JS in a manner which maintains institutional or
          organizational identity. The theme also emulates the
          navigation style of the Pearson TestNav8 practice tests for
          PARCC: non-linear but slideshow-style.  (This is how most
          QTI delivery engines, other than QTI.JS, interpret
          non-linear navigation mode.)  Some of the features of the
          custom theme require support from a qti.local.js
          script.</td>
